# AWS-AND-SNOWFLAKE-DATA-PIPELINE-PROJECT

ðŸš€ AWS & Snowflake Data Pipeline Project Complete! ðŸš€

Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project where I built a data pipeline integrating Snowflake and AWS to analyze high and low value trends over time. Using Snowflake as the core data warehouse, I extracted, processed, and transferred data through the pipeline into AWS for advanced analytics and visualization.

Key highlights:

Data Pipeline: Seamless integration between Snowflake and AWS.
Data Processing: Extracted and analyzed Sum of High and Low Values using cloud resources.
Data Insights: Top 2500 data points visualized for trend analysis.
