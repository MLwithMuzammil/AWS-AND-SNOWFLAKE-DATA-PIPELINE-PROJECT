# AWS-AND-SNOWFLAKE-DATA-PIPELINE-PROJECT

🚀 Excited to share my recent project on building a Data Pipeline using Snowflake and AWS! ☁️📊

This project was a part of my learning journey at Saylani Mass IT Training Institute under the guidance of Sir Qasim Hasan. I had the opportunity to implement a robust and scalable data architecture that integrates data from multiple sources into Snowflake, leveraging cloud providers like AWS and real-time data streaming from S3 using SQS. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

🔹 Data Ingestion from local systems via Snow CLI and cloud environments (AWS/Azure/GCP).
🔹 Snowpipe to automate the flow of structured & semi-structured data directly into Snowflake’s EDW.
🔹 Data Processing & Transformation inside Snowflake, ensuring high performance and efficient resource usage.
🔹 Performance Optimization with advanced Snowflake features and Time Travel for data protection.
🔹 Interactive Data Visualization with AWS QuickSight, making insights accessible for stakeholders in real-time.
